# unicubemaker
A header only library for distributing subdomains of simulations to multiple processes using UPC++

### TODO:
- Fix issue where the same process is stored as neighbors to a process node multiple times, but only the first instance is used as its neighbor
- Fix issue where copying DataNodes overwrites local connectivity
- Implement other topologies
